		<h1>Perceptions of the Future</h1>
		<h2>My research paper proved that artificial intelligence is beneficial for the future<br>
		 by surveying the current perceptions about it and providing evidence to create a<br>
		wholesome analysis. </h2>
		<h2>I started out my research paper with quote that I used as a hook. I emulated the behavior of Siri<br>
		and plan to do something similar with this paper. My plan is to create a more visual <br>
		interface for users to interact with this information.</h2>
		<h2>I will be changing the mode of my paper to a website. The core is as demonstrated, but I will<br>
		be making a lot of styling changes and will be incorporating major information from my paper onto this page. </h2>
		<h2>My goal is to make this information accessible and easy to understand.<br>
		Since artificial intelligence is based solely off technology, I thought it would be cool to change the mode to a website.</h2>
		<h2>By changing the mode of the paper to a website, I believe I will consequently changing the audience since the material<br> 
		will become easier to digest.</h2>
